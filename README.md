This project is a book review webiste where users can search for books. Users will be able to register for on the website and then log in using their username and password. Once they log in, they will be able to search for books, leave reviews for individual books, and see the reviews made by other people. I also use a third-party API by Google Books, another book review website, to pull in ratings from a broader audience. Finally, users will be able to query for book details and book reviews programmatically via my websiteâ€™s API.
